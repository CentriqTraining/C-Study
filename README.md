# C-Study
Word document study guide on the C# language

Work in progress.  This had taken me longer than I expected due to a busy week.  However, I'm doing my best to get it done.

I have gotten the main c# language content in there.

Missing:

Examples on some Class/struct components (methods, properties, indexers, events)

Object oriented

Cleanup and proof-reading.

Please forgive the errors.
Feel free to add an issue if you notice ANYTHING that isn't clear, seems wordy or seems overly complicated.  I'm really trying to make this as simple of a document as I possibly can.
